<!--if you add the javascript in the head it will delay the html loading so it would be better to add it in the body because it makes it seem like the page is loading faster.-->
<body>

<!-- we put the <script tag at the bootom for two reasons:
1. when the browser hits a script tag it will delay rendering the page so, for usability, if we put our script at the end the page will render faster 
2.if the javascript is excecuted in the head the body won't be rendered yet so we won't be able to manipulate our html-->
<script src="js/demo.js"></script>
